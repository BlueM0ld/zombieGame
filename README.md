# zombieGame
This is a text generated zombie game ! Also *sniffles* my first python project

## Installation

This application runs on windows through cmd/command prompt
you will need to have python3 and has to 64-bit or there might be an issue
installing tensorflow as it doesn't support 32-bit
Go into the root of the folder creativity

These are the dependencies you might need to run in order to run the application:
``
	pip3 install pyfiglet
``  
``
	pip3 install tensorflow==1.15
``  
``
	pip3 install gpt_2_simple
`` 
``
	pip3 install ibm_watson
``  
``
	pip3 install NLTK
``
- When you have install NLTK you will need packages within it
- run a python shell and the following commands
  ``
  	import nltk
		nltk.download()
   `` 
- The NLTK gui will appear and under collections select 'all' and download  
## Run 
After the nltk packages have been downloaded run the application on cmd by typing *start.py*  You should be in the directory of this file

To play the game wait for the prompt "you: " to show up after pressing E to enter the game
You can write in anything in the prompt :D

However "check inventory" and "surrender" are key prompts
